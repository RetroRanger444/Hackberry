## 📋 Problem Statement

**Context:** Innomatics Research Labs faced significant challenges in their placement process:
- **Manual & Time-Consuming:** HR teams spent hours manually screening hundreds of student resumes against job descriptions
- **Inconsistent Evaluation:** Different reviewers applied varying criteria, leading to inconsistent candidate assessments
- **Scalability Issues:** The manual process couldn't handle large volumes of applications efficiently
- **Missed Opportunities:** Qualified candidates were sometimes overlooked due to human oversight
- **Lack of Structured Feedback:** Students received limited actionable feedback for resume improvement

**Objective:** Develop an AI-powered system that automates resume screening, provides consistent evaluation criteria, and delivers actionable insights for both HR teams and students.

## 🎯 Solution Approach

### Architecture Overview
TalentMatch Pro employs a **microservices architecture** with separate frontend and backend deployments:

```
┌─────────────────┐    HTTP API    ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │   Requests     │                 │
│   Frontend      │◄──────────────►│   Backend       │
│   (Streamlit)   │                │   (FastAPI)     │
│                 │                │                 │
└─────────────────┘                └─────────────────┘

```

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. **Advanced Text Processing Pipeline**
- **Multi-format Support:** PDF, DOCX, and TXT file parsing with error recovery
- **OCR Enhancement:** Handles poorly formatted resumes with text normalization
- **Semantic Preprocessing:** Extracts key sections (skills, projects, education, experience)

#### 2. **Dual-Scoring Methodology**
- **Hard Skills Matching (70% weight):**
  - Comprehensive keyword mapping for 25+ technical skills
  - Weighted importance system prioritizing critical skills (B.Tech/BE: 20%, Python/SQL: 15% each)
  - Context-aware skill detection using fuzzy matching
  
- **Semantic Analysis (30% weight):**
  - Uses `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for contextual understanding
  - Cosine similarity calculation between resume and JD embeddings
  - Advanced preprocessing for better semantic matching

#### 3. **AI-Powered Feedback Generation**
- **Primary:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash for contextual, personalized feedback
- **Fallback:** Structured rule-based feedback system for reliability
- **Output:** Actionable suggestions for skill development and resume improvement

#### 4. **Scalable Deployment Strategy**
- **Backend:** FastAPI with async processing, CORS support, health checks
- **Frontend:** Streamlit with glassmorphism UI, real-time progress tracking
- **Cloud:** Hugging Face Spaces for automatic scaling and zero-ops deployment
